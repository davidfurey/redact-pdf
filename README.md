Web based tool for redacting PDFs for name-blind recruitment

This tool attempts to remove names, pronouns, email addresses and urls from CVs so that recruiters selecting people for 
interview aren't influenced by the candidates gender. It is not perfect, so I'd recommend a manual check of the results.
